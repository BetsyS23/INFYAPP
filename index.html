      <h3>🎯 Pitch</h3>
    <p>Introducing KING, an app designed to help people get ready for work by providing support for things 
      like missing IDs, resumes, and understanding job requirements. King gives simple step-by-step guides, connects users to local resources, 
      and provides direct assistance to help people of all ages become eligible for jobs. Our goal is to make sure 
      anyone who needs help with getting ready for work can find the support they need.</p>

    <h3>🌍 Theme Implementation</h3>
    <p>While Outplay Hunger focuses on providing individuals with access to food security,
      KING connects directly to this theme by addressing the crucial need for stable employment—helping people secure jobs that can lead to financial 
      independence and the ability to access essential resources like food. By helping individuals become ready for the workforce, 
      KING works hand-in-hand with initiatives like Outplay Hunger,this helps people face and overcome the different challenges that come with money and job problems.</p>

    <h3>🧠 Why We Built This</h3>
    <p>We built this app because many people struggle to find jobs—not because they don’t want to work, but because they’re missing important things like an ID,
      a resume, or other job requirements. We saw a need for a tool that could guide people step by step, connect them with local help, and make the job search easier. 
      Our goal is to support anyone, at any age, in getting ready for work and building a better future.</p>
