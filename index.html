    <h3>🎯 Pitch</h3>
    <p>
    KING is an app that helps people get ready for work.
    Whether you need help getting an ID, making a resume, or understanding what a job needs, 
    KING is here for you. It gives easy step-by-step guides, connects you to local help, and offers
    direct support so anyone can become job-ready.
    </p>

    <h3>🌍 Theme Implementation</h3>
    <p>
     While Outplay Hunger helps people get the food they need, KING supports them in finding stable jobs. 
    Having a job can lead to financial independence and make it easier to afford essentials like food.
    By helping people get ready to work, KING works alongside programs like Outplay Hunger to tackle money and job challenges together.
    </p>

    <h3>🧠 Why We Built This</h3>
    <p>
      We built this app because many people struggle to find jobs not because they don't want to work, but because they're missing important things like an ID,
      a resume, or other job requirements. We saw a need for a tool that could guide people step-by-step, connect them with local help, and make the job search easier.
      Our goal is to support anyone, at any age, in getting ready for work and building a better future.
